OUTSTANDING RELATIONSHIPS

Workplaces to Users - resolution table? : DONE

An item can be cloned to create a user specific version.
2 users may have Air Max but want to create a unique item for themselves.
These 2 items need to be linked to allow resevations to display relevant clashes.

If a user clones an item, they need to decide whether to display the image associated with the 
original item(s) or, add their own.

Multiple users may add 'khaki shorts'. A user needs to select which images are relevant to their 
own item.


When adding a new item, users need to set the relevant group, then type to see existing items.
From here, they can decide whether to clone an item (company T Shirt good example), or load their 
own, new item. The option to link to potential clashes then needs to be offered.
 - User 1's Khaki shorts are a clash of User 2's.

 Should User 2 be notified of this potential clash?

 Are reservations really relevant? It's more about possible clashes. This negates the idea 
 of paying a forfiet if you don't "dibbs" an item then duplicate the selection.
